# Prusa i3 Hephestos

## Description

Prusa i3 Hephestos is a single frame Prusa i3 derivative developed by the bq Department of Innovation and Robotics. We have chosen this model because it offers many improvements over the original i3 design and a very detailed documentation.

Bitfab's Hephestos kit has the following characteristics:

* Belt tensioners in X and Y axis, thanks to the Hephestos design improvements over the original Prusa i3.
* Compatibility with the Wade's Greg's Extruder
* LCD holder included, for use with RepRap Discount LCD controller.
* RAMPS holder with electronics cooling fan included.
* Removed and replaced the parts that have cable chain holders. No need to use cable chain from the beginning, although you can print the upgrade later.
* Improved Z axis top brackets, to achieve better threaded rod alignment by [jjimenez](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1657683)
* Improved Z axis endstop holder by [AndersV209](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:781100)
* Improved X axis endstop holder [AndersV209](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:784801)
