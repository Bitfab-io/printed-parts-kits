# Bitfab printed parts kits

This repository contains the printed parts kits produced by [Bitfab](http://bitfab.io). We maintain this repository for the following reasons:

* Keep a central repository with all the files and information used to produce printed parts kits at Bitfab.
* Allow collaboration for the Bitfab team and external contributors through git.
* Make public and accesible for customers, the community and other organizations all the information and resources that we have gathered for the production of printed parts kits.

Each kit has the following files and directories:

* **README.md** containing a description of the kit, attribution and license information
* **parts_list** list of the parts and quantities in the kit
* **stl_files** original `.stl` files
* **plates** standard plates (200x200mm, 300x200mm...), ready to be printed. Available in both `.stl` and `.amf` extensions
* **media** images of the kit and printed parts. Used for documentation and promotional purposes.
